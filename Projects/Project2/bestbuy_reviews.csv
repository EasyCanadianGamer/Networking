"Terrific noise canceling ability, decent bass when turned up on the equalizer in the app, comfortable faux leather padded ear covers, great adjustable size range, easy to use touch controls, multifunction soft touch button, great compact carrying case, comes with aux and USBC compatible charger cord, but no wall adapter, great transparent and motion tracking modes in the app, superb 40hr battery life, super clear built in mic. Great for everyday wear 8.5/10 could use a little more oomph in the bass department, not the most secure on head if you plan on using them for the gym, doesn’t come with a wall adapter for the charging cord even though it’s $370+, ear padding can get a bit hot at times if you are active while using them.",0.31249999999999994
"Review: Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are truly exceptional, living up to the premium standard Bose is known for. From the moment you put them on, you’re greeted with unparalleled comfort—thanks to the plush ear cushions and lightweight design, making them perfect for long listening sessions.

The sound quality is phenomenal. Bose has always delivered balanced audio, but the QuietComfort Ultra takes it a step further with incredibly clear highs, rich mids, and deep, punchy bass. Whether you’re listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the sound experience is immersive and detailed.

Noise cancellation on these headphones is next-level. It effectively silences background noise, whether you’re on a plane, in a noisy office, or outdoors on a golf course. The aware mode is equally impressive, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings when needed.

I use these headphones regularly outdoors, at the gym, and even while playing golf, and they never fail to deliver. The secure yet comfortable fit ensures they stay in place during physical activities, and the durable build holds up well in various conditions. The battery life is a standout feature—lasting over 20 hours on a single charge. It’s so convenient not to worry about charging them constantly. Whether I’m on the course, at the gym, or commuting, I know they’ll last all day without any interruptions.

The touch controls and seamless Bluetooth connectivity are intuitive and make using the headphones effortless. Pairing with devices is instant, and the connection remains stable even when moving around.

While the price is on the higher end, the QuietComfort Ultra headphones are worth every penny for anyone seeking premium audio quality, superior noise cancellation, and lasting comfort. They’re a fantastic investment for audiophiles, frequent travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, gym-goers, or anyone who values a top-notch listening experience.",0.2769510582010582
"Sound quality is extremely nice, wish it was more louder but for sure good enough. Had some connection issues though a week later, It was saying it was connected but no sound was coming through and it kept trying to connect to app but wouldnt. Had to double click Bluetooth an hold it for a long time, was very annoying but doesnt happen too often. Gonna replace this pair because of that. Noise cancelling is very good but could be a little better I feel like anyways (I understand they are ear muffs though and I do mow lawns so... still I barely hear the mowers). The battery life is god tier, literally all day I be playing music without it dieing on me very impressive. In love with these for sure!!",0.2779861111111111
"Exceptional audio, ANC, comfort, microphone clarity, and build quality. Out of the box, great experience on iOS, Android, Mac, and Nintendo Switch. Works with BOSE USB Link for superior/simpler performance on Windows. Works well with AptX dongles for wireless performance on PS5. Bose Music app is minimal but overall effective. ‘Smart’ buttons and functions are a bit clumsy. The ‘immersive’ audio is a tedious gimmick that I never use. Battery life could be better. If you’re loyal to Bose, these are a worthy revision. As always, price-to-performance doesn’t stack up against Sennheiser or Sony. Built-in Microphone doesn’t work when wired; included aux cable doesn’t have inline mic.",0.23160173160173161
"The quality itself of the headphones is great. I got mine especially and specifically because of the noise cancelling and the feature that allows you to adjust how much noise you want to block or how much you want to hear. As a current college student going into nursing school, I often find myself having trouble finding where to study because there is always loud noises going on even in the quiet zones of libraries so these were the best choice for me, and also because I have very loud nieces and nephews that visit me on a daily. Not to mention as a student I always find my computer or phone dying on me mid lecture so these will automatically connect to any other device I have paired it with allowing myself to easily begin the lecture on another device without having to search for them on the Bluetooth tab. On the other hand I am also a person that struggles with depression and anxiety and the only way to get myself together that has worked the best is by listening to music or exercising with a good quality sound device. Not only the quality of the audio but also comfortability, these allow me to adjust the size to my head, and the ear cuffs rotate so when they are not in use I can put them around my neck and they stay rotate stay flat against me and allow movement of my head. Also another plus is the battery life, I can sometimes use it 4 days in a row and won’t die on me easily.",0.22371212121212122
"I’ll start by saying I have never been a Bose fan. Most likely because I listen to mostly hip hop and I’m somewhat a bass head. Recently this has changed as I travel for work and really prioritize anc as I’m constantly in airports and on planes. For comparison, I've tried the Sony xm4s and 5s, neither fit my small head, momentum 4s, AirPod max, and beat studio pros. These are the best sounding head phones out of any I’ve tried in multiple genres, and I’m able to use the eq settings to get the bass I want. These fit extremely well, no discomfort on long flights, and without question have the best anc of all (AirPod max and xm5 are somewhat close). I never thought I would ever be a Bose fan but here we are! Picture attached just to show I’m somewhat addicted to headphones lol!",0.23026315789473684
"Bose outdid themselves with these hands down to them. I bought them because my 6 yr old Beets passed away and I had an upcoming business trip. Attended a meeting at the airport and the noose cancelling was above and beyond.  

I kid you not when I tell you that I didn't even liaten when they started boarding my flight and the folks on the call didn't hear any background noise either.

On the plane I activated the immersive mode and best audio I've heard so far.

I've worn them while working the entire day and theybare so comfortable,  don't hurt my ears and battery lasts for around 4 days straight.

Don't walk...run to get these",0.20555555555555557

"Bose never disappoints.  Every product that Bose manufactures is always better than the next one.
The Bose overhead noise cancelling headphones ultra quiet are no exception.  The sound,the great fit over the ears, the battery life combine to make this headset probably the best in this price range.  Another important feature is that the Bose Headset fits absolutely perfectly in its carrying case.",0.5125
I researched and had my eye on these Bose headphones for a couple months. I purchased while on sale and truly enjoy the sound quality and features. Easy to setup and use. Best sound quality of all headphones i every purchased or tested.,0.5266666666666666
"Wow, just wow… I used to have the AirPod Max’s and I fell in love with them, I still felt that the price didn’t make any sense. I thought I wouldn’t find any better headphones than Apple’s but boy oh boy, this are excepcional.

1. Quality : headband it’s pretty comfortable just like the ear cups, I could listen to music for hours and not get irritated by such. The frame is a mixture of plastic and aluminum (if im correct) but they feel great.
2. Price : it’s a great price for what you’re getting
3. Pairing mode : you can connect several devices but you can only switch back and forth between 2 devices of which you can select in their app. Pretty easy
4. App : really good app, it shows tips and tricks
5. Audio Quality : BEST NC OVERALL, better than apple
6. Case : Listen, it’s just perfect and compact",0.40185185185185185
"I purchased these in the middle of December 2023.

These headphones are comfortable, and the audio provided feels next level. I come from the Sony - WH1000XM4 Wireless headphones I had for two years. The noise canceling is more profound than the Sony's, but it feels great. 

The Bose app works great and allows you to customize some settings. 

The headphones widen comfortably for larger heads.

My only concern is that I sometimes would like the audio quieter, but I can't turn it down to the volume I want without going all the way down to mute it. It may be an iPhone aspect because I have used the headphones on my PS5 and can find a comfortable volume there.

It may just be the noise canceling working a little too well, haha, but I felt it was worth mentioning.",0.2115451388888889
"As a music producer with a keen ear for sound quality, I carefully considered several factors before purchasing the Bose QC Ultra headphones. While the AirPods Pro Max have a strong reputation, I found them to be somewhat cumbersome. Similarly, after testing two different Beats models, I was disappointed by their lack of innovation despite being recent releases.

I initially bought the standard Bose QuietComfort headphones but decided to upgrade to the Ultras, and the additional $100 was well worth it. The noise-canceling capabilities of the QC Ultra are unmatched, and the app integration with my iPhone is seamless. The option to connect to multiple devices simultaneously is a standout feature.

There is a slight learning curve, as with any high-quality headphones, but after a week of use, they become second nature. I also appreciate the prompt, same-day delivery from Best Buy, which has proven to be a reliable and preferred shopping experience over other platforms.

Having used the Bose QC Ultra headphones for about a month, I’ve had zero issues. The battery life is impressive, lasting several days on a single charge. The ‘Immersion Mode’ effectively blocks out external noise without compromising sound quality, and the ability to customize noise-canceling settings for different modes is a fantastic feature. Overall, I’m extremely satisfied with this purchase.",0.14000850340136053
"In 2024, we all know Bose for delivering top-notch audio experiences, but let's dive into the nitty-gritty of the Bose QC Ultra headphones. First off, a bit of a letdown – no passthrough audio when using a cable. You've got to make sure the battery is juiced up and the headphones are turned on to catch those beats when connected with a 3.5mm cable, even if you are using a DAC.

Now, speaking of cables, you might want to invest in a longer one. The included cable is pretty short, even for in-flight use.

The physical buttons are a nice touch, but there's a minor hiccup – a 4 to 5 second delay from pressing the power button to hearing the chime when turning them on and other unreliable results when pressing the buttons, so you got to get used to it.

Connectivity is smooth if you stick to one device, but the multipoint feature is a bit wobbly. It tends to auto-pause music or disconnect randomly. AND, you have to manually switch devices using the button (a bit of a bummer).

Let's talk noise-canceling – it's downright impressive. However, calls are a different story. The self-voice feature is a letdown, and the automatic turn-off when not in use is hit or miss. Don't be shocked to find your headphones drained if you forget to manually power them down.

A quick note on Aptx – it supports Aptx Adaptive, not Aptx, Aptx LL, or Aptx HD. Also, Snapdragon Sound is cool, but only a handful of devices support it, making it more of a ""future-proof"" feature for a future that hasn't quite arrived.

Now, onto comfort – they're cozy to wear. I appreciate the design; it's not too big or small. However, those flat hinges might play a little pinchy with your ears, fingers, or neck occasionally, and it's worth noting that they tend to collect fingerprints (see photo).

Why am I airing out these grievances but keeping them? Well, I'm hopeful that some of these quirks will get sorted with firmware updates. Plus, let's be real – they sound fantastic, and the noise-canceling is the cream of the crop.

BUT, if you're not too fussed about immersive audio and ""snapdragon sound"" (which can be a bit gimmicky), a previous model might suit you just fine (and be nicer with your pockets).",0.14278549382716052

"Very comfy, I can see how ppl say it’s not “loud enough” but these are perfect, their never uncomfortable loud just like the perfect amount to me. Their really comfy and don’t hurt my head after using them for so long. I have a pretty big head and ear lol but they fit comfortably. The noise cancellation is the best and what I love the most. Helps a lot when getting overstimulated by sounds in public. If u want really painfully loud headphones these are not for u, if u want to escape the sounds from the world and listen to music for hours without getting a headace these are for you. Very portable and looks very good. Had them for under 2 months I still use them regular and daily",0.33521739130434786
"Very comfortable to use for a long time. The noise canceling is top tier, better than the AirPods Max. The quality feels premium.",0.3675
"These headphones are great! I had the QC 35’s for a long time and recently upgraded to these. They’re really comfortable and im really enjoying using the Aware mode. The one thing i am missing is the on/off switch. The button works fine but I liked the switch better. Leaving them on and having them automatically go to the sleep mode is nice but it does make the battery life worse, so i do like turning them off when not using them.",0.3013888888888889

Downsides: connecting to pc wireless can be difficult at times, battery life is not great, canf use while plugged in to charge",0.19
"I have to say, after a weekend of use with different media; music and movies, these are wonderful headphones.  Bose finally has integrated immersive sound (basically, dolby atmos) and the results are awstounding.  The help of noise cancellation puts you in the music.  The quality of construction is superb as usual.  But, my favorite is how light they are on my head.  This is something Bose has mastered.  All and all, an A + for sound quality, construction and design.",0.3833333333333333
"I have tried a few noise canceling earphones and headphones, but Bose is just on a different level when it comes to it. The sound quality and noise canceling is absolutely superb! There are no other choices when it comes to listening to your genre of music and actually hearing all the instruments that are being played. Now the noise canceling is on a different level, they are no competition when it comes to Bose noise canceling. Try it out and you will be amazed!",0.18035714285714285
