5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5’s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don’t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort’s buttons to the Ultra’s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver.  While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  The sound quality is second to none.  It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears.  The 45’s require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1).  Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45’s, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in.  Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5’s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  I run an air purifier at arm’s length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head.  With the XM5’s I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they’re simultaneously running.  With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45’s I can easily pick up the a/c.  The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose’s way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don’t mind it.  Others may mind it, however.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45’s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they’re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don’t work out, but I would imagine they’d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45’s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5’s require using the app, the Sonos don’t do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don’t even offer multipoint functionality.  Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I’ve found that to be accurate.  While that’s less than the Sonos and Sony’s battery life (30 hours), it’s more than the Apple’s (20 hour).  I have found the battery life to be  sufficient.  If you own a pair of 45’s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there’s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you’re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.  Happy Listening!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned various Bose products in the past and have always been impressed with them! These wireless headphones are no exception.The sound is fantastic. Whether it's a podcast, film, audio book, or music, everything is detailed and clear. There is depth and although there is a good deal of high end, it is not harsh to my ears. There is enough bass for me with the default EQ setting. (If you aren't happy with the EQ, you can adjust it in the app.) I listen to everything from classical, blues, and jazz, to classic rock and progressive metal. It all sounds good through these headphones.Setup was quick and easy;no issues there at all. I mainly use these with my iPhone and iPad. Bluetooth seems solid even if I leave my phone or tablet at the other end of the house which is nice. I am very impressed with the battery life! I can easily go a day or two without charging and that's with pretty heavy use throughout the day and evening depending on what I'm up to.The earcups and headband are comfortable, they are lite, and the carry case is a nice touch. IT's small enough that it will be easy to travel with. I like that they updated their headphones with USB C.The noise cancelation is pretty good, however, they don't equal the Apple Airpods Max in that department. (That's not a deal braker for me but I thought I'd mention it all the same.)All in all, these are great and I would buy them again.Bose make excellent products!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you. That Cypress Green sure looks good though, right? Ok, bye bye bye now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bose QuietComfort Headphones: Excellence in Comfort and Sound QualityI’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort 45 for a few weeks now, and I can confidently say they’re among the best headphones on the market. Bose has long been a leader in audio quality, and these headphones only reinforce their reputation.Sound Quality: The sound is crisp and clear, with powerful bass that doesn’t overpower the mids and highs. It’s perfect whether I’m listening to classical music, rock, or podcasts. The sound feels immersive and natural, which makes a huge difference in long listening sessions.Noise Cancellation: Bose’s noise cancellation technology is top-notch. When I put these on, it’s like flipping a switch that drowns out the world. They block out background noise in busy environments like airplanes, trains, or cafes, allowing me to fully focus on my music or work. The “Aware Mode” is also handy, letting in ambient sound when I need it, without taking off the headset.Comfort: True to their name, the QuietComfort 45 headphones are extremely comfortable. The ear cups are soft, and the fit is just right—not too tight or too loose. I’ve worn them for hours without any discomfort, which is a rarity with most headphones.Battery Life: Bose claims 24 hours of playback, and it holds up well. The fast-charge feature is convenient, especially if I’m in a rush; a quick 15-minute charge gives me a few hours of playtime.Build Quality and Design: The design is sleek and professional, and the headphones feel durable. The buttons and controls are intuitive and responsive, making them easy to operate without needing to look at my device.Connectivity: The Bluetooth connection is stable, and pairing is effortless. I can even connect to two devices simultaneously, which is perfect for switching between my laptop and phone without hassle.Overall Verdict: The Bose QuietComfort 45 is a fantastic headset, combining comfort, excellent sound quality, and industry-leading noise cancellation. While they may be on the pricier side, the quality justifies the investment. If you’re looking for a headset that delivers on all fronts, I highly recommend these!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a “general audience’s” needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"There's just something about Bose quality and design. These headphones are perfect if you're looking for good sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, and--maybe most importantly for me--comfort. I don't know how they did it, but these really are crazy comfy to wear. They have a snug fit to boost sound quality and noise blocking, but they aren't tight at all and have a very nice, cushiony feel. I inevitably get headaches from wearing any other over-ear headphones for very long, but I've gone hours with these on my head and almost forgotten they're even there. I also like that they're not super-duper big and ostentatious. I'm not looking to wear these as a loud fashion statement and I like how sleek they are as-is. And I love the way they fold up to fit in their nice little case. It's the least awkward folding-of-headphones I've seen so far.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to sound quality, but I can tell you from personal experience and preference that the quality on these is great. Not the best out there, since, hey, you're not paying $600+ for these, but excellent nonetheless for me. You do have to have the volume up a bit to get the really epic listening experience, but that's no different from other over-ear headphones I've owned. The connected app is a no-frills affair that lets you adjust the sound a bit to your liking, and you can create additional listening modes with your preferred EQ, but I've been happy with the as-is modes already programmed into it. Set up with the app was blessedly uneventful. It connected on the first try and I've never had a bit of trouble connected new devices to my headphones. Glorious.Let's talk noise-cancelling. When that switch is flipped, the world outside your headphones is gone. It doesn't feel unnatural like you're sitting in a vacuum, but it does let you happily escape all the noisy distractions around you and just enjoy whatever you're listening to at whatever volume you prefer. I have to formally announce to anyone else home that I'm putting my headphones on because, aside from physically touching me or doing some acrobatics in my direct line of sight, I can't hear them at all if they're trying to get my attention--which, obviously, I love. Kind of the point of noise cancelling, right?The design of the headphones is simple and to the point in terms of controls. The last two pair of headphones I owned before these had awkwardly placed buttons for volume and pausing. I would always fumble to find them even after owning them for years. The controls on these Bose headphones are somehow placed just perfectly, and my fingers land on them on the first try every time. It's a little thing since a lot of us use our phones or smart watches to change the song and what not, but when I really am immersed and want to leave all distractions aside, using the controls on the headphones is a nice little treat, and that lack of fumbling to find them goes a long way to allowing me to stay in that happy and calm little headspace.I want to give these five stars for the price I paid (which, btw, was a sale price of 249.99 USD), but there's a couple of small, intertwined drawbacks for me that puts them at between a 4 and 4.5: the battery life and the power toggle/slider. The battery life is, in a word, fine. My previous headphones went for weeks of sporadic, casual listening without me needing to charge them, but they weren't as fancy and they weren't noise-cancelling. These Bose headphones need fairly regular charging, which isn't the end of the world, especially since--I assume--they use up more battery thanks to the awesomely effective noise-cancelling. It will last a long airplane trip but you'll need to charge it pretty soon after that or else you're going to be sans-headphones for at least part of the flight home.Then there's the power toggle. In general, I love this little toggle/slider. It's nothing but a tiny, silly, minor inconvenience, but I'm not a fan of the hold-this-for-a-little-while power buttons that also double as the button you need to activate Bluetooth/Bluetooth pairing. I always feel like an idiot when it's time to pair a new device to it and I can't figure out if I need to triple press the power button or what. A nice, small and easily accessible toggle/slider to turn the headphones on and off? Fantastic.The downside? You sure as heck better remember to turn the headphones off when you're not using them or they're going to remain on until the battery dies. In my experience, with that all-powerful toggle there is no automatic powering off if you leave the headphones out of use for an extended period of time. It will just drain that battery until the headphones are dead. It's a simple solution--just remember to scoot that slider to off when you're done with them! But, lamentably, I'm super forgetful and easily distracted, and some of you might be the same. I've now accidentally left my headphones on three times, and even though it is my fault, I've been pretty bummed that my headphones are totally dead when I pull them out again after that moment of forgetfulness. The automatic powering off after inactivity in my previous headphones is the one feature that I really, really miss. Is this a dealbreaker? Would I go back to those headphones because of this? Absolutely not. But from one concerned, forgetful listener to another, just remember to manually power down, even if you think you're only going to be stepping away from your headphones for two seconds :)Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat, but I probably won't need to. I've had them for seven months now but, if they're anything like the Bose speakers I've owned, they're going to last me a lot longer yet. Would I pay the full 350 USD price for them? Maybe. I got mine on sale, and they were even cheaper during Prime Day 2024. They're an awesome set of headphones, but if the price is still a little steep for you, maybe add them to your list and keep an eye on it. Bose products tend to go on sale periodically for much better discounts than, say, Apple products, especially around the holiday season."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love how comfortable these headphones are! I’m someone who constantly has neck pain and migraines so it’s been such a relief to finally find a quality, comfy pair of over-the-ear headphones.Previously I had the AirPod Max but it was just way too heavy both in general and in terms of its feel on my head. I wouldn’t be able to wear them for long at all before it hurt and again it was just so HEAVY to carry to work or college. I bring these with me every time I commute (in an already heavy enough purse or backpack), so them being so light is a huge perk.The only thing I will say is that the noise canceling isn’t the greatest out there. It’s good enough when the volume is up at least halfway, but if you’re looking for something with crazy noise cancellation rather than something for comfort, I’d say get something else. I use it on the NYC trains and buses and find it good enough, but I know some people like to hear absolutely nothing in their environment. Without risking damage to the ears by raising the volume up pretty loud, this isn’t the headphones for that. I’d say the same in terms of sound quality. The sound is pretty good/ good enough for someone like me but maybe not for someone else who takes sound quality more seriously.Overall I would highly recommend these headphones for those who usually experience pain from the weight of over-the-ear headphones and want something super convenient to travel around with them! Also I got these on sale for 200 bucks which is such a steal. Wait for the sale!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,As a migraine patient I have to be really careful about anything I put my head. Anything can give me migraine. I’ve tried dozen of headphones till I found this. This is the lightest headphones I’ve ever tried. You feel different since the moment you put this on on your head. Speakers are located behind the ear. This is the reason why I chose this. Since the voice not going into ear directly not giving me headache at all. Battery life is incredible. I fulled the battery and im using for a week and it still %60 full. Connection with my apple devices is ok but not as fast as AirPods. When you want to switch one to another you have to do it manually. This is tricky but I could ignore this only for other features it has.  Mic quality is good as well. First time I had phone call I looked back like the person I’m talking was behind me. The voice was clear and alive like a real person talking.Im using mostly at gym. Noise cancellation is working great. It feels like you are in an isolated room and speakers are behind and you are enjoying your music while working out. Only thing I can criticize is it slides when you lie on your back.I’m feeling really happy with my purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones are amazing! I wanted something reliable and ultra quiet for the gym as an upgrade to my Apple Airpods. I explored the Apple headphones and decided the price point was just too steep. I got these on sale for Prime Day so they came out to about $169 and I could not be more satisfied.My experience at the gym is amazing. No more being disturbed by loud obnoxious grunts next to me on the treadmill. The sound on these headphones is unmatched in my opinion. I tried some Soundcore headphones that just didn't get loud enough for me. I needed to be at max volume to listen to my liking. With the Bose, I can listen at a comfortable volume with a few clicks to spare before the max. I also love the Bose app that allows you to customize your sound experience, noise cancelling level and wind blocking.I also use these for hearing protection while near very loud helicopter engines or if I don't want to be overstimulated by my loud blender or vacuum.Aside from the great performance, the appearance is sleek. They are not too wide off the ears and the emerald green is beautiful.Battery life is great for my personal use. I use them for about 3 hours every day and only lose about 10% a day. If I don't use them for a week+ the charge holds so I don't have to worry about them being left in my gym bag for a while.Overall, if someone is looking to invest in some great quality headphones I would highly recommend these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros.  I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights.  I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights.  Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs.  So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare.  I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits.  But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs.  This is my personal opinion and what works best for me.  Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions.  Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN:  I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups.  I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros).  I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure.  They fit my adult daughter much better.  The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft.  The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so.  The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC:  In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation.  I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy.  Comparable to airplane noise but quieter.  The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product.  But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes.  The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light.  The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP:  I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant.  Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments.  I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app.  Same goes for the Air Pods.  The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok.  Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference.  The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile.  It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me.  You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others.  The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options.  It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose.  Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING:  Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY:  For me, I love the Beats functionality.  Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design.  AirPods are similar.  So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn.  The 1More Sonoflow is last here.  All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front.  The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE:  Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all.  AirPods are AirPods.  The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small.  The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped.  Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING:  Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE:  This is of limited importance to me.  But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read.  The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices.  I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices.  Charge your stuff.  Not that hard."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:Battery last for a long time, Mic quality is good, I like the size as they’re not huge but they also seem kind of small too.Cons:They don’t seem very durable and honestly my $50 headphones from target look almost identical to these and when comparing the two I don’t see enough of a difference that would justify spending the higher amount of money. I never thought of myself as having a small head but these tend to slide/fall off of my head all the time when I’m cleaning so I don’t know how they would hold up to wearing while working out as I don’t workout in order for me to know.While I like these headphones like I mentioned above I don’t feel like they’re that much different than the $50 one I bought at target. They’re literally the same color, have noise canceling and awareness to them just like these hose ones do. The only thing that made me keep these was the earpad fit. I have gauged ears and pretty large ones at that so most headphones sit right on my jewelry and cause my ears to hurt after a bit. These are more oval/oblong shaped than round so my ears sit inside the headphones as opposed to the headphones resting against my ears. I don’t have sore ears or a headache after wearing them and that’s the only thing that made them work for me. If you need a decent pair of headphones and want the same features I would reccomend the ones from target for a great dupe. The sound quality isn’t much different either in my opinion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not a headphones pro by any means so my opinion is completely non technical and based on my checklist of what i wanted in a headphone. My checklist includes very basic things like price, wireless capability, noise cancellation,  cannot fall off my head, decent charge time.1.Price:  I got these on prime day deal for almost half the price which mainly made me buy them.2.Wireless capability: I think bluetooth is very powerful. I kept my phone in my room and went in the kitchen and it doesnt disconnect easily.3. I think they are decent in blocking the external noises ( havent tried them on a teams call yet)4. Comfort: they do stay on the ears without any discomfort and are lightweight which is a plus for me. I feel like it wont hurt if i wear them all the time. And perfect for workouts and running5. Chargetime: they lack a bit in this area  having only 24 hours with a full charge. Other brnds perform much better in this area with 30-50 hours of play time with a full charge. However it is stated that with 15 minutes of charging a play time of 2.5 hrs can be achieved with these headphones which is good enough for a quick run/ excercise session for me( if the claim is true) .Bonus:1. I got the blue color limited edition and i absolutely adore it2. They come with wired option so can connect quickly to my laptop( true for all headphones really)3. They are lighweight and have a sleak design. They already look expensiveI must admit though, the main deciding factor for me was the price as i wouldnt buy them for a full price of $350 for sure."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound.  For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel.  Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like.  All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range.  They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use.  Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life.  Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly.  Even the mid range model  WHCH710N which had a lot of issues.  They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music.  Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily.  I thought it was a worth while investment.  I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further.  A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones.  I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones.  The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it.  But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used.  I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long.  I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent.  Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to.  They also have a great volume range.  This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy.  For this price point I expected more metal parts.  The materials look well made and have excellent form factor.  The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell.  I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces.  This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie.  The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them.  I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great.  If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery.  The following morning they are already at 50% battery.  So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use).  For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge.  I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them.  Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this.  I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think.  There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor.  Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.  I am happy with. mySummary:PROS:  Sound Quality, Comfort, Weight, Form Factor, Easy Setup, Reliable Bluetooth ConnectionCONS: Battery Life, Durability"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones exceeded my expectations! I listed out what feel like key features in my experience with them so far.Comfort: Being over the ear makes these immensely better than all other on-ear headphones I've ever tried. I tested these on a long haul flight 9 hours long and found they were incredibly comfortable. I also like ear buds, but those can hurt after a long period for me.Noise cancellation: This feature blew my mind - it's even better than Apple AirPods and totally drowns out sound. It's everything you need to be able to sleep on a long plane ride.Price: These are expensive, which is why I waited so long before buying. I did luckily purchase these on sale for $150, so might be worth keeping an eye out for future sales before splurging.Sound quality: I'm no audiophile, but can appreciate the customizable EQ sound settings and respective mobile app. You can change bass, treble, and mid sound setting to your preference.Battery: These headphones last forever! Something like 20 hours, which is much higher compared to any earbuds I've ever used."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"⭐⭐⭐⭐**Excellent Sound and Comfort – A Few Minor Quirks**The Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones in Moonstone Blue are truly impressive! Right out of the box, the color is stunning – the limited edition Moonstone Blue is unique and stylish. These headphones are incredibly comfortable for extended listening sessions, and the ear cups are plush without causing any discomfort.The noise-canceling feature is top-notch and blocks out almost all background noise, making them ideal for travel or working in noisy environments. The sound quality is superb, with deep bass, clear mids, and sharp highs that make music and podcasts sound amazing.Battery life is great too; I’m consistently getting close to the promised 24 hours, which means I only need to charge them every few days even with heavy use. My only minor complaint is that I wish I could do more with the button controls. It’s a small drawback, but worth noting if you rely heavily on touch commands.Overall, these are excellent headphones that live up to Bose’s reputation for quality, with a fantastic color to top it off. Highly recommended for anyone looking for premium noise-canceling headphones with comfort and style!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These Bose Headphones are so comfortable i catch myself wearing them, forgetting i’m not even listening to anything! LOL. THE VOLUME control is amazing if you like to hear crisp sound plus bass. The size is so comfortable. Bluetooth is great cus once you turn it on it gives you the battery% which is incredibly helpful! Mic is great for calls, and the length of cord is just right! Also the noise canceling i barely use but the headphones definitely drowns outside noise! I love these so much! Wireless, Bose is the way to go! Btw, side not, it’s so nice you can charge your phone and still listen to anything you want. Rather than wired earplugs… Welcome to the future! Get these your ears will thank YOU!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,The noise cancellation is great where you can barely hear anything when you put it on max noise canceling (you have a range that you change on how much noise cancellation you want) but I’m not sure if I’m too sensitive as when I put it on max my head does start to feel the pressure that I would get from being on an airplane so idk. But it was very easy to pair and was durable enough to even sleep with them for a few nights even though you can’t side sleep haha. The headphones are pretty light but I did feel the pressure on my head but not too much but it’s just that I’m picky. I did end up returning these headphones as I decided to switch for the black color because I thought the white color would actually be fully white but in person it’s more like an off white that’s like just a little gray but hey I’m just picky. Overall I would say I liked this headphone enough to pay another $40 for the black color instead 😭😭😭.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d caution against purchasing this product. Any problems within the return policy of this company would seem to require anyone in Hawaii to pay for the return and basic box size costs around $24.00 with upwards of $4.00 to insure it because it’s over $200.00. That’s just if you decide you need to return it. The Bose warranty is decent but my experience is that the warranty requires you to return it to Bose first and then they replace it and it all takes about 60days that you won’t have this super pricey headphones. Having said that, here’s my review: the sound quality is average. Even using their Bose app the most you can do is choose presets and adjust the  EQ a bit. The internal ai is difficult to hear, interrupted Siri when phone calls come in. Even though it interrupted and overrode SIRI it didn’t automatically switch from Audible app to the call! It just keeps repeating that you have a call and it tells you that you’re connected to your iPhone. Um, not sure what good that was supposed to be but it’s amazingly irritating and you still have to MANUALLY choose the headphones on the phone app. The voice is robotic and,unlike Siri, doesn’t do anything to help you answer the call. During the time that the headphones are spouting this silliness, the buttons to answer the call DON’T WORK. The noise cancellation is not even as good as my NC25’s and although it has a “modes” setting on the app with a “windy conditions” setting in its “Outdoor” mode, it doesn’t do much to increase or improve sound quality within the headphones because it doesn’t really block outside noise well. When I need noise cancellation I really want the headphones to actually block all noise so I can meditate or listen to books or music without any interference or distractions. This headphones doesn’t do that job. The mic quality is scratching and picks up all the noise around you during the call you finally manually accept because the voice is nattering on unintelligibly and actually ends up amplifying the sounds around you. That’s terrible 😣 the ear size is adjustable upwards or down but the inner ear area isn’t padded at all and the padding on the outer ears is minimal and not very comfortable so that my tiny ears kept rubbing against the inner plastic and ended up being painful after a bit. I couldn’t experience the length of time that it would keep doing something because IT DID NOT HAVE A CHARGER BLOCK and I wasn’t able to get it to work with any adapter I own (6 different ones) so it never could charge and the charger light wouldn’t go on. And after 24 hours it was still at 40% according to the headphones voice… I couldn’t say much about its durability except that the plastic ear parts felt flimsy and it would need delicate handling. The headband squeezed my head very badly (I sincerely have a pretty small head width and I wear a size small hat size to give you an idea of my head size!) and after about 30 minutes it hurts to the point of pain and I took it off until the pain decreased. no matter how I tried to adjust it using the “sizer” parts on the top on both sides, this badness was the usual. The volume control worked but because the app doesn’t do much besides let you adjust the eq a bit, I didn’t get the sound that was clear and bottom heavy. This box didn’t come with ANY startup manual except a bit of info about their app that’s on the box but the app doesn’t really tell you how to do anything besides check battery and use preset settings. the app doesn’t do much so I couldn’t even get sound equal to an NC25 which is a super inexpensive headphone. It’s not worth the price or the bother. In this price range you should get premium service that doesn’t take 60 days turnaround that leaves you without your headset for 2 months and requires you to send your headset first in order to get the replacement. It’s possible that because I’m not rich I just don’t have enough of something in the qualifications department to rate this headphones properly but if Bose is catering to “regular people” like me who wants the best quality sound at the $300.00 price range then maybe they should think a bit about what people they want as customers. I’m sadly disappointed in Bose over this headset. I’ve owned a couple of their clock radios and they are awesomeness incarnate! These headphones just kinda don’t have the same Bose that we’ve all come to expect and deserve. I wish they’d just redesign the thing and move forward."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are hands down the best headphones I’ve ever purchased. I have the newest AirPods, and they cannot compare to the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. The ear size is perfect, no issues with connectivity, the color is spot on, and the sound quality is supreme. The battery life alone is insane. I could use my AirPods for a full day, and then they’re dead. The Bose headphones have been on 100% after two days of multi hour use. The only drawback is you have to install an app on your phone, but with the quality of these headphones, I would install 10 apps if I had to. If you’re on the fence between these and the air max headphones, buy Bose."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got home on 11-07-24 and she was waiting for me. Unboxed and turned her on and she announced that she was at 60%. Powered up my iPhone 12, iPhone 14Pro, iPad mini6, iPad 9th generation, and my Sony Bravia 86. All paired flawlessly in 10 minutes after downloading the Bose app. Sound was as satisfying as it gets. At $199.00 it makes it that much better. This will be my Long Haul flight set replacing my AirPod Max. I can tell already they will be much more comfortable for long flights. I will edit this review after some time for the sound and edit function’s comparison.First impressions are so far very good. That’s why 5 stars. Cypress Green and does not feel “plasticy” as some reviews have said."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update note as of Oct 2024- I have only one complaint with these.  For reason unknown, when I have conversations with these headphones, the conversation breaks up.  I am not getting that issue with the QC45 or the NC700's.  <Oct 2024.I have the QC45, NC700 and recently gave a relative the QC35ii's (only because they don't use the USB-C plug).  Plus, it gave me an excuse to buy this QuietComfort.The reviewers said that the new Quiet Comfort headphones sounded better, and since they were on sale for $200, I grabbed them.  They look and feel just like the QC45's I have.As for sound I really CANNOT honestly swear that I can hear a difference compared to the QC45.I think they have a stronger bass tone, but that could just be in my mind to justify purchasing another set of Bose!  For we have some wired QC25's too.What did happen, is to avoid buyer's remorse, I finally played with the EQ settings on the Bose app, which did truly kick up the sound quality, which I always thought was good, but kind of flat.Of course, when I applied the new settings to the NC700's and QC45's, I got the same improvements.The main advantage of these is the app allows you to select from a choice of presets in the EQ modes, that the NC700 and QC45 don't have access too.  Have I used any of those presets.  NO!Bottomline- Great Bose headphones, as good as the others.  You may hear an improvement in the strength of the bass tone.  But are they an absolute necessity over the existing QC45, or QC35ii's, not in my mind.However, as I indicated I still have excellent QC25 wired Bose headphones, and they are still good.  So know, if you have Bose, they should last a long time.Hopefully, the Ultra's won't drop down to $250, because I know I will buy them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally purchased Beats over the ears headphones. I thought they were supposed to be the best. Once I received them, The were heavy and tight on my peanut head. Just didn't feel right especially if I'm walking around in the park or going for a walk which might be for more than an hour. So, I returned them with Amazon, no hassle and ended up looking at reviews at other headphones. I have headphones from Bose that I've had for years but they aren't wireless and use batteries, but they work great. So I ordered these headphones and they are awesome. Light, and yes plastic but isn't everything now? Bluetoothed to my phone beautifully and sound amazing. BTW, I got them on the Amazon Oct. 8 & 9 two day sale. Got about $100 off! When I check them now, it really is $100 more than I spent. I did get the 3 year insurance plan, not sure I needed it, but I did it. Overall - Great headphones and you can trust BOSE!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Personally found that the headphones were really comfy and snug for me, I could wear it for multiple hours without feeling pain which is usually the case for other headphones! Sound is great too after EQ.Just one issue - the frequent static sounds when the headphones r connected to two devices at the same time. It’s known for multiple device connection yet failing terribly due to the static sounds. It’s rather frequent till I have to switch the multiple device connection function off. If you are buying it, just note this is what you’re going to experience. If you’re still okay with this then go ahead to buy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only great things to say about this head set! I usually meditate in the afternoon and have started using these for my music. But the biggest A+ is that the music comes over perfectly clear and any surrounding noise does not! And I’m talking about nail guns, hammers and of course the neighborhood landscapers. I am so happy I finally treated myself to a headset and that I picked these. They are so comfortable, lightweight and not hot! The ear pieces are comfortably padded and the adjustable headband is not to tight. I cannot say enough good things about this purchase! Highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"They were not messing around when it comes to quality - you are inside the sound. Helps me with meditation and drowns out background noise. I'm someone who has very sensitive hearing, and I can never listen to anything past half volume, so I was impressed with low volume sound quality. Haven't tried it on a plane yet, but I can't hear anyone in other rooms at home or outside cars/dogs, etc. Dark green looks nice with my red hair too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve gotten by with Wyze ANC headphones for the past couple of years and while they are just fine, the Bose are a notch or two above. Crystal clear sound, comfortable, light, great ANC, and love the color choices (I got forest green). I really can’t find any fault with these. I will say if you’re considering the Pros, the noise cancellation on those may be a bit better as the base QCs let in a tiny bit of sound. But overall they are fabulous for $199 and would recommend them at that price point."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"updating my QC45 to this new QC, color and headband is diffferent - nice!  i can hear the difference in noise canceling affect!  appears ear cups are thicker / solid than QC45 which helps noise canceling affect.  Worth the dollar for me, I cannot fly without this QC45, and now QC is my new airplane partner / blue color is fun.  when powered up, it has a new fun activated sound!  all features appear same as QC45, except for longer battery life of new QC.  i have tried test fitted other over ear headphone, and Bose has been my go to / for gym wear without noise cancel model - less cost and effective for gym / not have to hear gym's general loud music mixes. Gave my old pair to friend / he loves it / good for sleeping quietness if you can deal with headphone wearing while sleeping."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not only is this a pretty color, it works wonders in blocking all activity around you. When I wear them, I can't hear the tv in the living room. Or my son working from while typing away on his keyboard, or when meetings are happening via Zoom. This is life changing. The headphones are soft and very comfortable to wear. I can enjoy the show I'm watching without interrupting another household family member. The battery last several days and I can hear everything crystal clear."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these to travel with. All of my home audio is Bose and figured I would give them a shot. Worth every single penny. Way to go BOSE. I love that I can put it in aware mode or quiet. The battery life is amazing and the sound quality is amazing. I specifically bought these to block out the noise of the jet engines and now realize I'll be using them for more then travel. The moment you put it in quiet mode it blocks out all noise around you.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been wanting headphones for a while. I’ve been comparing many brands but chose to try these since they were on sale and in a great color. I am not disappointed - these are great! Noise cancelling works awesome (there is jack hammering at my work so it helps) and sound quality is better than expected. Charge these and they last on battery for a long time. I have no complaints and am so happy I picked right!
5.0 out of 5 stars,These headphones work incredibly well. The sound is very clear and the 808’s sound incredible but not over the top that’s going to blow your eardrums out. I love using these to edit videos for school because I can hear everything so clearly for hours on end. The battery life is very long. I haven’t charged them for a few days and they’re still at 70% battery life. They’re still fairly compact for headphones and fold up nicely in the case. I thought they were gonna be clunky to carry around but they’re not clunky at all! Love these 10000% worth it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these primarily for use at work but I also use them at the gym or for neighborhood walks. The Bose brand and their reputation was a key factor in my purchasing decision. I wasn't disappointed, these have outstanding audio quality! I love the noise canceling mode, especially because I'm very ADHD and need to block out distractions. These really help me get into a ""zone"" and stay there. They are also very easy to use and connect via Bluetooth. The included case for them is useful for storage and transport. No issues with the battery life for my uses. I bought on sale but they are worth the price tag!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am in love with these headphones. The noise cancellation is AMAZING. My coworkers have literally had to throw things at me because I can't hear them at work when I have them on. The sound quality is so much better than my AirPods, where I had to put my volume up to max and still not hear very well. Hands down the best headphones I have ever gotten. Well worth the money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music.  These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work.  Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong.  You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is.  That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.Excellent hardware/buttons etc:- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally- USB-C charging- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss.  Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to.  For example:  you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby).  You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway.  It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I study/do homework at my university campus all the time and this helps me focus since it blocks 95% of the very noisy student union crowd. Unfortunately it is useless for phone calls. Recipient says my voice is so quiet that they can barely hear it. Too bad because otherwise it would have been perfect. Battery also lasts me a long time, and it is the first headphone that does not give me a headache from the pressure."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prime day deal made it so I could buy these.  They are, by far, the best headphones I've ever owned. The noise canceling is very good, but I bought them for the Bose reputation for sound quality.I have a very nice Yamaha Atmos sound system in my living room,  but after hearing music through these,  I don't want to go back to it. It's that good.Comfort is excellent, I've been wearing them for a few hours and could easily wear them for a few more.Battery was at 90% when I started using them,  still at 90% about 3 hours later. I've not used the microphone,  and probably won't so I can't say anything about it.Definitely worth the price."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's early. I've had them a couple of weeks. I got a good deal, and they were back-ordered.I recognize Bose at where they excell- great noise cancelling, build quality, comfort and a headband, above all, that will last.  The Sony WH-1000xm sounded great, balanced, but the headband was a complete travesty.  I've done a nice electrical tape repair and have them as backup. They still sound good.Bose has never excelled in fidelity. They sound good in a way. Pleasing, warm, bassy, bottomy., a bit soupy, syruppy.  But I have a Bachelor of Music on guitar and minored in Sound Recording Technology. and I had learned to listen very critically to timbre and space and musicality at a very young age.It will please the masses.  Bose are a bunch of legacy MIT electrical engineers and physics majors and phDs fashioned in the image of their guru founder, Amar Bose who himself was an MIT phD electrical engineer.. And if any one of them actually has musicality and musical judgment, they're certainly not allowed to speak it into the product.As far as high fidelity, Bose was ragged on when the company actually tried competing in the so-called high-end loudspeaker space as ""BOSE= Buy Other Stereo Equipment"". They don't really image great, they don't have shimmering, glistening silky highs, the bottom was usually muddy.I will say the bottom is pretty pleasing on these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only bad thing about these is the price. Even on sale, with all the options out there, these should be lower priced. But I can sleep with them. It blocks all the loud noises in apartment living so I can sleep. They're lightweight, breathable, and very comfortable to wear. They are definitely one I would recommend, but when they're on sale. Even the sale I did buy these on, I felt they were over-priced, but because I need my sleep. it is worth the price. Definitely great design and I love the shape of the headphones as they completely cover my ears to block all the noise and doesn't hurt my ears."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased for a 87 year old senior citizen birthday. He was too old to understand how to switch TV sound to the headphones, and didn’t want to learn.That doesn’t change the value of them. My husband has two sets of them and he is 81. We both love it because he can listen to TV and I can read."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I got the color moonstone, absolutely stunning color, Picture doesn’t do it justice, it’s much more rich and blue irl,  Second, the noise cancellation is so impressive, the way it can switch between aware where it sounds kind of like when you wear AirPods, to Quiet like wearing air traffic controller headphones is so impressive. Third, they are very comfortable to wear and fit your ears like a glove. Fourth, the Bose app is worth a download if you want to adjust the EQ like I did, I turned up the bass, and you can make your own mode between aware and quiet through the app. Overall I can’t really think of any cons personally, but of course Bose is always impressive and never disappoints!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise canceling is great, comfort is great. I can even sleep most of the night with these on, listening to white noise, I sleep on my back. After using all night it still has 80% battery left. If battery is dead you can still use them using the aux cord. Bought on sale for $199. 10/10"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My fiancée had requested some noise cancelling headphones so she could better focus while she’s reading and I’m gaming or watching tv.She has not taken them off except for work, sleep and eating. She loves the headphones, loves the audio quality, and I know the noise cancelling works as I can sit right next to her talking and she has no idea what I’m saying.Her only complaint has been that she cannot listen and charge at the same time. This seems strange limitation to me, as almost all devices have power pass through capabilities. Maybe this is a misunderstanding as I have not tested this myself.It took her a little getting used to the controls, but now she’s proficient and hasn’t complained about how the controls are setup or laid out.The size of the headphones is really compact, and the provided carrying case is a nice touch. It would be super cool if the case had a battery that could charge the headphones while they are stored away similar to how the carrying cases for the in ear headphones work.All in all, a great set of noise cancelling headphones with amazing noise cancelling and will definitely keep your significant other happy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is amazing. The comfort is wonderful. I love how it tells me the percentage charge and tells me what I connecting the headphones through. I really appreciate it telling me with the push of a button that I am ""aware"", meaning I can hear some outside sound. I use them when walking and it is important to be able to hear cars. I am a.fsn!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a pair of these for my grandson.  He raved about them.  I finally bought myself a pair.  They are by far so clear, comfortable, no background noise whatsoever!  I would recommend these as best I’ve ever used.  I am getting my husband a pair for Christmas.  Get them…you won’t be sorry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love these headphones. They were exactly what I was looking for. The green color is perfect and versatile. They're super comfortable around the ears and there is padding at the top of the head, which actually makes a huge difference when wearing for a long period of time. I wore them when traveling recently and I don't think I can ever fly without them now.. I can be pretty sensitive to sound and stimulation, so drowning out the sound of crowds in the airport and the loud hum of the plane during flight was absolutely amazing. It was actually kind of jarring to take them off mid flight and realize how well they work! My husband works from home and works different hours than I do, so it's so helpful to be able to wear them while reading, relaxing, listening to something, or taking a call of my own while he's on a call in the other room. The microphone has been super clear when I've hooked them up to my computer. And Aware mode is perfect for when I'm taking a walk in the neighborhood and want to listen to a podcast. It's doesn't feel safe to walk with complete noise cancellation, so this is the perfect solution. I did a good bit of research before making this purchase and I decided to spend a little more on the trusted Bose brand; definitely made the right choice for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I work outside a lot using loud machinery, so I purchased these Bose QC headphones for use when I am mowing or splitting wood.  The headphones work great!  I can hear voices or music perfectly and drown out the machines.  I love the aware setting, quiet setting and I have even customized an 'in between' setting.  I should have purchased these long ago and saved some of my hearing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally upgraded from my last pair after 4 years with bose they were a little worn out but still working. For esthetic reasons I wanted a new cleaner pair and this color was giving! But Baby when I put them on it was like a movie theater with the sound effect. Absolutely love the quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great. They are quiet and comfortable! In fact they are very very quiet. The quiet mode option is amazing! I enjoy shutting off the noise of the world and these do that very well. The sound quality is great as well. I do have a smaller head and I find that these for me very well and are comfortable. They are tight enough to fit without slipping around but loose enough to not give me a headache.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"These headphones have great sound quality you’d expect from Bose. The new app is easy to use and switching between devices is seamless. I am always going back and forth between my phone and work laptop, and the handle it perfectly.  Great hassle-free headphones!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great battery life, good noise cancellation, great sound for music and movies. I ordered these for flying and waiting in terminals and they make airport waits and flying bearable (even eliminating the unhappy very vocal toddler during the flight)!!Comfortable for a 4 hr flight!"
